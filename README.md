I love creating solutions to problems that make my daily life harder, so others dont have to experience the same strugle.

I like to make everything as professional and as flexible as possible, even simple scripts.

Here you can find my story, interests, what I am learning and some fun facts about me.

### 🙃 How I got into programming

I got interested in programming because, I had an old iPod 4, that was given to me for only 40 dollars, when iOS 7 cameout I loved the new cartoony/flat design, I was around the age of 10, so I had no way to update it, this is what got me into a concept called Jailbreaking, just to install Winterboard and an iOS 7 theme, my interest on how those things were made started, so I started learning the magic of programming, starting with Scratch.

A few years later at 13/14 I had a Lenovo laptop, that had this weird bug, where basically, it would type "zyzyzyzy" out of nowhere, after my dad tried to fix it by giving it to a lot of techninitians, and them saying it wasn't a hardware failiure but an unremovable virus, I had an idea, so that day I installed Linux, that got me into Bash scripting.

Today programming is not only my hobbie but a passion, and all thanks to having very old hardware, today this is no longer an issue, but thank God I had old hardware, if no who knows where I would be now, probs taking photos on Snapchat wondering what kind of magic that is.
