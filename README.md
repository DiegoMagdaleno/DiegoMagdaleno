I love creating solutions to problems that make my daily life harder, so others dont have to experience the same strugle.

I like to make everything as professional and as flexible as possible, even simple scripts.

Here you can find my story, interests, what I am learning and some fun facts about me.

### üôÉ How I got into programming

I got interested in programming because, I had an old iPod 4, that was given to me for only 40 dollars, when iOS 7 cameout I loved the new cartoony/flat design, I was around the age of 10, so I had no way to update it, this is what got me into a concept called Jailbreaking, just to install Winterboard and an iOS 7 theme, my interest on how those things were made started, so I started learning the magic of programming, starting with Scratch.

A few years later at 13/14 I had a Lenovo laptop, that had this weird bug, where basically, it would type "zyzyzyzy" out of nowhere, after my dad tried to fix it by giving it to a lot of techninitians, and them saying it wasn't a hardware failiure but an unremovable virus, I had an idea, so that day I installed Linux, that got me into Bash scripting. _Fun fact: Days later I dualbooted Windows and the issue was gone, I wonder how did they restored that thing, it worked for me first try without the "zyzyzyzyzyz" issue_

Today programming is not only my hobbie but a passion, and all thanks to having very old hardware, today this is no longer an issue, but thank God I had old hardware, if no who knows where I would be now, probs taking photos on Snapchat wondering what kind of magic that is.

### üî¨ My primary interests

I have a lot of interests in programming, but here are some things I love a lot and Im interest in:

- **Package Management:** I love this concept, package managers are a thing that should be universal (Looking at your Microsoft), they allow us to get things instantly, running a command, I have worked on many on this before or contributed to some projects, just to name a few:
  
  - Novus: Novus was a package manager for macOS, similar to what you see in iOS with Cydia or Sileo, it started back in 2018 with a few friends, and it was based on another package manager named Brew, it was indeed just a Brew frontend, however this project failed, it was my first project and my experience was very low to guide it to sucess.
  
    Back in 2019, 1 year later after the initial failure me and my best friend SmushyTaco revived Novus, using Pac-Man (Yes the Arch Linux package manager) after       having some trouble with the repos, we decided to switch to APT (By Debian) since the ecosystem was already used on iOS, I had some incredible team members like      Diatrus (That helped me a lot with APT, patching the boostrap, etc), Ultra and EvenDev (That made most of the GUI) and SmushyTaco (That contributed many ideas      and rewrote many stuff in Rust)

  - Contributed to Spack: I contributed to Spack, recently it is infact a package manager that I love, sadly is broken on current macOS versions, my contributions range from better behaviour when running as root to adding some packages.
  
  - Contributed to Brew: I have contributed a few packages to Brew, and I maintain my own Brew repo, I love the scripting power Ruby has, but I wish it was a little faster
  
- **Core utilities:** While I love the concept of free software, I think that if we as developer choose to close source a program/app/service we should be able to do so, but this isn't a thing in the GPL license, this is why another one of my interests as an open source lover, is to port and update many BSD utilities to multiple UNIX operating systems, you can find those projects here in my GitHub.

- **Build systems:** Back when Novus was a thing (Since it failed) the main repo was named "Project Serna", it was amazing, however, there was a problem, compiling software manually was a pain, I was interested on how Brew, Debian, etc. Were able to maintain all this software, and its when I discovered automated build systems, a concept I thing should be implemeneted and I dream some day with having this universally implemented, I love the idea of having a build system, that you could drop technically anything and it will compile it, so a package manager can later install it. I still work on this idea, a long with package management.

- **Making computers more intuitive:** I believe that some operations we as "power users" or developers do shoulnd't be exclusive, this is why im interested into making "complex" things easier, in fact, I am working on many projects (Classic developer with 100000 unfinished projects) to make for example something as simple as file hierarchy more intuitive and easy to use, and I hope I have something of this in the future.

- **Unified UIs and Experiences:** I cannot stress this enough, but I feel like all devices should feel like one in different form factors, in fact im an Apple user because of the ecosystem, I think we should be able to perform the same operations on one device or another with similar experiences or UIs, this is why I absolutely love the Apple ecosystem. 
  
  And I would love seeing something by Google similar to this ecosystem in Chromebooks, or KDE with KDE mobile, or even GNOME! This is one of my favorite things when it comes to computing, this is why you will normally see an attempt of my own to make my software run everywhere. 
  
- **UNIX:** I love UNIX-like operating systems, in fact, who doesn't?, this is why im interested in porting software from one UNIX platform to another, normally this is easy, except when the software is dependant on GNU syscalls, you can tell I don't like gnulibc, but I do love writing software that works the same or very similar in all *NIX operating systems! This is why my software normally works in both macOS and Linux, and since macOS is BSD-like it also works on BSD, sometimes, when the planets aling, it works on Windows.
